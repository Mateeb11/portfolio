### What I learned

Design:<br/>

- How to use Figma correctly.
- Design for all screen sizes.
- Design hover effects.
- Design validation status.
- Group design components.
- Template for project colors, font sizes, and font weights.

Code:<br/>
In this project I needed a email service, so I used EmailJS. It was so easy to config and use with any project, their dashboard is easy and clean. It gives you 200 email per month for free users.

Here is the config in the code:

First you need to import the library:

```js
import emailjs from "@emailjs/browser";
```

Then you add a function (sendForm) and fill it with your service essential codes, then you call it in any action you want:

```js
const sendEmail = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  emailjs
    .sendForm("YOUR_CODE", "YOUR_TEMPLATECODE", form.current, "YOUR_CODE")
    .then(
      (result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
      },
      (error) => {
        console.log(error.text);
      }
    );
};
```
